    Bluetooth
        A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances.

    Bluetooth Classic
        The original version of Bluetooth, which is used for audio streaming and file transfer. Also known as Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR).
    
    BLE
        Bluetooth Low Energy, a version of Bluetooth that is optimized for low power consumption.

    ISM
        `Industrial, scientific, and medical frequency band <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band>`_. An unlicensed but regulated frequency band used for industrial, scientific, and medical devices, spanning from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz.
    
    FHSS
        Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching a carrier among many frequency channels.
    
    Host
        The host consists of the higher layers in the BLE stack. Its responsible includes: the Generic Attribute Profile \(*GATT*\), the Generic Access Profile \(*GAP*\), the Security Manager Protocol \(*SMP*\), and the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol \(*L2CAP*\). :ref:`Details <ble_stack>`
    
    Controller
        The controller consists of the lower layers in the BLE stack. Its responsible includes: the Physical Layer \(*PHY*\), the Link Layer \(*LL*\), and the Isochronous Adaptation Layer \(*ISOAL*\). :ref:`Details <ble_stack>`

    HCI
        Host Controller Interface, a logical interface that defines a way in which the Host and Controller components may communicate. :ref:`Details <ble_stack>`
